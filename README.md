# Stock Analysis R

### Description

Download the **nasdaq_symbols.xlsx** file from the datasets area in the campus. It contains symbols and companies names for the Nasdaq stock market.

Create a report where you analize the relationship between the average daily return and the volatility (sd), for each symbol.

Is (daily) **profitability** related with (daily) **volatility**? 

Create a clustering of companies, using the mean and sd of daily returns as the spliting variables. 

Analyze the results.
